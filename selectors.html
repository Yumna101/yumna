    <h1>This is a heading styled using an element selector</h1>

    <p class="highlight">This paragraph is styled using a class selector.</p>
    
    <!-- ID Selector Example: The <p> element with id 'unique' is targeted by its unique id in the CSS -->
    <p id="unique">This paragraph is styled using an ID selector.</p>

    <button>Hover over me</button> <!-- When hovered, the button style will change (defined in CSS) -->
    <p class="hover-text">Hover over this text to see an effect.</p> <!-- When hovered, the text will change based on the pseudoselector -->
